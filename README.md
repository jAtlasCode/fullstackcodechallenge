## Full stack code challenge I completed with some extra functionality, see bottom for list of requirements.

## Available Scripts

## clone the repo

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Requirements:
For this challenge we would like you to create a React application and an API that uses restaurant data from the attached JSON file. The React application should present the data in a table and allows users to filter that data.

User stories are as follows:
• A user should be able to see a table with the name, city, state, phone number, and genres for each restaurant.
• A user should see results sorted by name in alphabetical order starting with the beginning of the alphabet
• A user should be able to filter restaurants by state.
• A user should be able to filter by genre.
• State and Genre filters should default to “All” and take effect instantaneously (no additional clicks).
• A user should be able to enter text into a search field. When hitting the enter key or clicking on a search button, the table should search results. Search results should match either the name, city, or genre.
• A user should be able to clear the search by clearing the text value in the search input.
• A user should only see 10 results at a time and the table should be paginated.
• A user should be able to combine filters and search. The user should be able to turn filters on and off while a search value is present.
• If any of the filters do not return any restaurants, the UI should indicate that no results were found.

What we are looking for:
• No use of third-party component libraries for the table/filter/search.
• Using Create-React-App or Next.js as a starter kit is okay.
• The API layer should use either Node, Java, or Python. It can be a REST API or GraphQL.
• Filtering and pagination can be done on the API or Front-End layer. Do what you think is best.
• Well organized file structure
• Descriptive naming conventions
• DRY code that is readable and production ready
• Reusable components
• Sound logic for how the filters are architected
• Styling follows a convention/pattern and is well organized
• Full Git history with atomic commits

Stretch goals:
• Deployed application
• CI / CD
• Unit tests
• TypeScript
• Table row click shows additional information
• User can sort the data by name and state
• Add filter for attire
• Feel free to get creative!
